    <h1> Briards </h1>

    <h2> A Heart wrapped in fur </h2>

    <p class="intro"> The <a class="breed" 
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wikiBriard"> briard </a>
        , or berger de brie, is a large breed of 
        dog traditionally used as a  
           herder and guardian of sheep.</p>

           <h3> Breed History</h3>

           <p> >The briard, which is believed to have originated
                in France, has been bred for centuries to herd
                 and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the 
                 French Army as sentries, messengers and to 
                 search for wounded soldiers because of its fine
                sense of hearing. Briards were used in the
                 First World War almost to the point of
                 extinction. Currently the population of 
                 briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne,
                 Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all
                  owned briards.</p>
